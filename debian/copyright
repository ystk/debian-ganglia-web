Comment:
 The core Ganglia package was debianized by
 Preston Smith <psmith@foobird.net> on
 Tue, 16 Apr 2002 22:55:55 -0500.
 .
 The ganglia-web component has been split into a separate upstream
 tarball with a release cycle independent of the core Ganglia upstream
 releases.  The Debian artefacts from the original combined source
 package have been adapted by Daniel Pocock <daniel@pocock.com.au>
